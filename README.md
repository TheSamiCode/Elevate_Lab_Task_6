# This section showcases a curated set of SQL query examples categorized into:
- Non-Correlated Subqueries
- Correlated Subqueries
- Derived Tables

# Categories & Descriptions
1. Correlated Subqueries (co-related sub-query ex1, ex2)
These queries depend on values from the outer query. They are executed row-by-row and are ideal for:
Comparing values within groups
Filtering based on dynamic conditions

2. Non-Correlated Subqueries (non co-related sub-query ex1 to ex7)
These are independent subqueries that run once and return a static result. Use them for:
Filtering with IN, =, or EXISTS
Aggregating values for outer queries

3. Derived Tables (derived table ex1 to ex3)
These queries use subqueries in the FROM clause to create temporary tables. Useful for:
Pre-aggregating data
Simplifying complex joins
Modularizing logic for readability
